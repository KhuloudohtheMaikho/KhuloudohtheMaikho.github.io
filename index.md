## Khuloudoh Maikho

My name is Khuloudoh Maikho, I am a 19 year old guy pursuing B.Tech. in Aerospace Engineering at IIT Bombay. I have grown up in various cities and my current permanent address is in Jaipur, but obviously I actually reside in the IIT Bombay Campus.
I like sketching, listening to music, not any random music, only the ones which trigger my imagination...cinematic imagination. As a consequence, I also imagining stories, stories large enough to have their own novel. I used to draw comics when i was younger, but as I grew up my stories became larger, sketching became detailed and I no longer found time to pursue them actively. I also had a desire to teach high school Physics which was quenched by NSS IITB's Educational Outreach program. Thats how I discovered that I have a knack of teaching and even currently i would be willing to teach people the core subjects which I have understood well.

These were all as far as my hobbies are concerned, apart from that, I like core aerospace stuff typically Spaceflight Mechanics and Structural Mechanics and would want to go into one of these subdomains in the future.
